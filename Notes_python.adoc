= Python notes

== Search for imported files and environment variables

You can control where Python finds files that it is trying to import
in the following ways:

- Add to `sys.path`.  Example:
+
----
import sys
sys.path.append('/another/directory/containing/my/module')
----

- Set the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`.

- Move your module to a directory that is in `sys.path`.

- Use a `.env` file and the `dotenv` module --
