= Notes table of contents and lnks and locations

== Comments

To edit/show any of the files listed below, use `Ctrl-w gf`.  See:
`:help ctrl-g`.

I still need a way to collect all my notes in a repository (Bazaar,
Mercurial, or Git) so that I can manage them and push them to
another machine.  Perhaps a repo/directory containing symbolic
links.

== Locations

- Main -- /home/dkuhlman/Txt/Notes.txt

- Erlang -- /home/dkuhlman/a1/Erlang/Notes.txt
- Erlang rebar3 -- /home/dkuhlman/a1/Erlang/Rebar3/Notes.txt
- Vim -- /home/dkuhlman/a1/Source/Vim/Notes.txt
