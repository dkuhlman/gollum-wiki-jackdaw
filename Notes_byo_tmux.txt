== Display session name on byobu status line

I added the following in `~/.tmux.conf`:

----
set-option -g status-left " #S "
----

then I did:

----
$ tmux source-file .tmux.conf
----


== X windows

For info about this, see: 

- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/146631/in-tmux-session-cannot-connect-to-x-server-after-sshing

- https://goosebearingbashshell.github.io/2017/12/07/reset-display-variable-in-tmux.html

But, none of the above seems to work.  And, one of the above Web
pages seems to conflict with the other.

So, I added the following to my `.bashrc-private` on `quail`:

----------
export DISPLAY=:0.0
----------

**The following does not work.**

Adding the following in `~/.tmux.conf` enables me to open Xwindows
programs on the local machine.

----------
set-option -g update-environment "SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY"
----------

Note that "DISPLAY" is missing from the above.

To see current values, do:

----------
$ tmux show-options -g update-environment
----------

An alternative is to set the `DISPLAY` environment variable to the
needed value:

----------
$ export DISPLAY=:0.0
----------

To learn the correct value, do the following (1) remove the
statement in `.bashrc-private` that sets `DISPLAY`; (2) create a new
terminal window; (3) *outside a tmux session*, do `$ echo $DISPLAY`.

Another alternative, if possible, start tmux from the local machine,
i.e. the on machine on which I want to start the Xwindows apps.


== Window size -- smaller client

When the window is shrunk because of a smaller client size, do one
of the following:

- Use the `list-clients` and then the `detach-client` command.
  E.g.:
+
----------
$ tmux list-clients
$ tmux detach-client -t /dev/pts/0
----------

- Can also use `CTRL-A + SHIFT-D`, then select session to close.

- Or, easier still, with Byobu, use `Alt-F6` (`Meta-F6`, `M-F6`) to
  detach all but current client.

- Or:
+
----------
tmux detach -a
----------
+
The "-a" means detach all *other* clients.
