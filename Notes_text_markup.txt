== `asciidoc` and `reStructuredText`

=== Overview -- Transforming asciidoc to reST

----------
#!/bin/sh
asciidoctor -b docbook5 -o - $1 | pandoc -f docbook -t rst -o $2
----------

Or, to write to `stdout`:

----------
#!/bin/sh
asciidoctor -b docbook5 -o - $1 | pandoc -f docbook -t rst
----------

There are scripts for each of the above on crow in: (1)
`~/bin/asciidoc-2-rest.sh` and (2)
`~/bin/asciidoc-2-rest-stdout.sh`


=== Details -- Convert asciidoc to reST (reStructuredText)

I often write in Asciidoc (and use Asciidoctor as my converter).
But, I need reStructuredText for my blog.  So, to convert from
Asciidoc format to Docutils reStructuredText format, I used
`asciidoctor` and `pandoc`:

----------
$ asciidoctor -b docbook5 some_file01.txt
$ pandoc -f docbook -t rst -o some_file01.rst some_file01.xml
----------

Notes:

- I installed `asciidoctor` as a `ruby` `gem`.

- `pandoc` can be installed with the `aptitude` or the `apt-get`
  package manager.

- `pandoc` is also included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.


== Asciidoc attributes

Some sample attribute assignment in the document header:

----------
= My document title
:toc:
:toclevels: 4
:toc-title: Contents:
:sectnums:
----------

Notes:

- Each of the above attribute assignments is optional.

- There must be no blank lines in the document header.  Attribute
  assignment must start in column 1.


== Asciidoctor footer

For HTML output, create a file containing HTML code to be inserted
in the footer.  Create it in the currect directory and name it:
"docinfo-footer.html".

Set the following attributes in the header of the source document:

----------
:docinfo: shared
:nofooter:
----------

Here is a sample footer file (`docinfo-footer.html`):

----------
<hr/>
