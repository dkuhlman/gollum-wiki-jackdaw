== Resolving hosts on local network (LAN)

This stopped working on `magpie` and `quail` after I upgraded them to
Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.  Here is what I did on `magpie` and `quail`.

The wrong `nameserver` was in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

I followed the instructions here:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/201603/should-i-edit-my-resolv-conf-file-to-fix-wrong-dns-problem

I changed `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head` -- Added
"nameserver 192.168.50.1".

Then, I ran:

----
sudo resolvconf -u
----

Alternative solution (?).  Recommented (?) -- Add
`dns-nameservers x.x.x.x y.y.y.y` to `/etc/network/interfaces`.
