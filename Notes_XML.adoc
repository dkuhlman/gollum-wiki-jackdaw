== Alternative ways to write out an element tree to a text file:

Python 3 requires that when we write text to a *text* file, we pass
it a `str`, not `bytes`.  Since `Lxml/etree`, in some cases, produces a
`bytes` object, we either have to convert content to
`str`, or write to a binary file/buffer.  Examples:

- Open an output file in binary mode:
  `outfile = open('junk.xml', 'wb')`.

- Convert the element tree to a string:
  `etree.tostring(root, encoding='unicode')`.

- Use `elementtree.write()` with the buffer object in the output file:
  `doc.write(outfile.buffer)`.

- Or, decode to `str`:
  `sys.stdout.write(etree.tostring(root).decode())`
