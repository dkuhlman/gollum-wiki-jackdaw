== State change error

While updating, I got this message:

----------
E: Repository 'http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian buster InRelease' changed its 'Suite' value from 'testing' to 'stable'
E: Failed to download some files
W: Failed to fetch http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/dists/buster/InRelease:
----------

I fixed it by running the following:

----------
sudo apt-get update --allow-releaseinfo-change
----------


== Change default user and name

[copied from:
https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/how-to-change-the-default-account-username-and-password
]

In order to change the username `pi` we will have to log in as the
`root` user since it's not possible to rename an account while your
logged into it. To log in as root user first we have to enable it,
to do so type the following command whilst logged in as the default
pi user:

----------
$ sudo passwd root
----------

Choose a secure password for the root user. You can disable the root
account later if you wish.

Now logout of the user pi using the command:

----------
$ logout
----------

And then log back in as the user `root` using the password you
just created. Now we can rename the efault pi user name. The
following method renames the user `pi` to `newname`, replace this
with whatever you want. Type the command:

----------
$ usermod -l newname pi
----------

Now the user name has been changed the user's home directory name
should also be changed to reflect the new login name:

----------
$ usermod -m -d /home/newname newname
----------

Now logout and log back in as newname.


== apt, aptitude, etc

I had a problem with a change in the "Suite value" of the
repository.

I followed the instructions here:

https://askubuntu.com/questions/989906/explicitly-accept-change-for-ppa-label

I did the following:

----------
$ sudo apt-get --allow-releaseinfo-change update
$ sudo aptitude update
$ sudo aptitude -s install neovim
----------


== i3wm and applets

Also see `i3config.txt` (in the current directory).

I used `aptitude` to install these packages:

- network-manager
- network-manager-gnome
- clipit

I added these to the end of the `i3wm` configuration -- `~/.config/i3/config`:

----------
#
# gdk
workspace_layout tabbed
#exec --no-startup-id parcellite
exec --no-startup-id xscreensaver
exec --no-startup-id clipit
exec --no-startup-id nm-applet
