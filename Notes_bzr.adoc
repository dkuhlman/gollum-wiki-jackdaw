== Initialization

Created a shared repository containing branches for `Notes` and
`Reviews`:

----------
$ mcdir txt_master_01/
$ bzr init-repository .
$ bzr branch ~/b1/Notes/Bzr/Notes
$ bzr branch ../Reviews
----------

Q: Is it possible that a shared repository is *only* intended to
contain multiple branches of the *same* project?
