== Arch Linux -- starting services

To start a service do, e.g.:

----
$ systemctl start sshd.service
----

To make it start automatically at boot time, do, e.g.:

----
$ sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
----


== Alternatives

See `/etc/alternatives`.

Do `man update-alternatives`.

Use:

----------
$ update-alternatives --install target name source priority
----------

Where:

- `source` is the new link that will be made.  It will be a
  symbolic link to something in `/etc/alternatives`.

- `name` is the name of the symlink in the `/etc/alternatives`
  directory.

- `target` -- is the executable that will be referred to
  (indirectly) by `source`.

Example:

----------
$ update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/lua lua-interpreter /usr/bin/lua5.3 120
$ update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/luac lua-compiler /usr/bin/luac5.3 120
----------

Which will result in the following links:

----------
/usr/bin/lua --> /etc/alternatives/lua-interpreter --> /usr/bin/lua5.3
/usr/bin/luac --> /etc/alternatives/lua-compiler --> /usr/bin/luac5.3
----------



== SSH logon

Instructions on how to set-up logon for SSH using ssh-keygen are
here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen

I used:

----------
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "some comment"
----------

For example:

----------
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Access from quail"
----------


I believe that now that I've generated those files, in order to
support an additional remote machine, I only have to copy id-rsa.pub
to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine and change its
permissions to 640: ``chmod 640 authorized_keys``.

An easy way to copy the key to the remote machine is to use
`ssh-copy-id`
on the machine *from* which you want to logon.  Example:

----------
$ ssh-copy-id dkuhlman@scrubjay
----------

In order to not enter a passphrase when connecting, run
``ssh-keygen`` and, when asked, do not enter a passphrase.  Then add
``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` (on the local site) to
``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` (on the remote site).

If I get a message something like the following:

..........
Warning: the ECDSA host key for 'crow' differs from the key
    for the IP address '192.168.0.7'
Offending key for IP in /home/dkuhlman/.ssh/known_hosts:2
Matching host key in /home/dkuhlman/.ssh/known_hosts:16
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? no
..........

Then remove that key with the following:

----------
$ ssh-keygen -R 192.168.0.7
----------

Do this on the machine from which I was trying to make the
connection.

Make sure that environment variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK is not set.  If it
is, add the following to ~/.bashrc-private:

----------
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=
----------

For info on setting up keys and passphrases for ssh, see:

- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH?action=show&redirect=SSHHowto
- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys


== aptitude, apt, and apt-get

To install a package from a `.deb` file, do:

----------
$ sudo apt-get install ./opera-stable_60.0.3255.59_amd64.deb
----------

To find out what (installed) package contains a specific file, use:

----------
$ dpkg -S <pattern>
----------

*Note:* The above only works if the package containing `pattern` has
been installed.

To list the files in an installed package, do:

----------
$ dpkg -L <package-name>
----------


=== Remove old Linux kernels

I removed old kernel files with the following:

----------
$ sudo apt autoremove
----------

We can also remove kernel files version by version with the
following:

List the kernels -- Use either of the following:

----------
$ dpkg --list | grep linux-image | vv
$ dpkg --list | grep linux-image | less
----------

Then remove one or more kernel and update `grub`.  For example:

----------
$ sudo aptitude  remove linux-image-4.15.0-24-generic
$ sudo aptitude  remove linux-image-4.15.0-29-generic
$ sudo update-grub
----------

Although, it does not seem that the `update-grub` step is needed.
It seems to be taken care of by `aptitude`.

Use the following to check amount of space used:

----------
$ df -h
----------


== i3 and applets

See in the current directory:

- i3config.txt
- Notes_raspberry.txt

=== Sound

To adjust volume, use: `pavucontrol (1) -- A volume control for
the PulseAudio sound server`.  Under `i3`, use `$mod+d`.


== Networking

=== Network discovery and exploration

To find out what hosts are attached to the local network, do one of
the following:

----------
$ arp -v
$ nmap -sP 192.168.0.*
$ nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24
----------

=== Host name resolution, DNS, avahi

From crow, I was unable to ping Raspberry Pi hosts by name.  I had
to use IP address (number).  I did:

----------
$ sudo aptitude  install avahi-autoipd avahi-daemon avahi-utils
----------

Now, that problem seems to be solved.  I can now do:

----------
$ ping -c 2 magpie
$ ping -c 2 quail
$ ping -c 2 jackdaw.local
$ ping -c 2 rook.local
$ ping -c 2 bluejay.local
----------


== Copy files between hosts (scp)

Use `scp` (secure copy).  Example:

----------
$ scp dkuhlman@crow:b1/Python/Templates/template01.py tmpl1.py
----------

Use `vim`.  Example:

----------
$ vim scp://dkuhlman@crow/b1/Python/Templates/template01.py
----------


== Processes

Several ways to display current processes:

- `htop` -- Inside `htop`.  Use backslash ("\"), then type a
  string in order to filter processes.

- `ps aux | grep <proc_of_interest>`

- `ps -ef | grep <proc_of_interest>`

- `pgrep -l <proc_of_interest>`

Notes and hints on the `ps` command:

- Standard syntax uses a dash ("-") for command line options.  BSD
  syntax does not use a dash.  The option letters are different for
  the two syntaxes, but you can (mostly) get the same results with
  either.

- To show a process tree, use: `$  ps -ejH` or `$ ps axjf`.  This
  can be useful, e.g., to determine which bash process is running
  `vim` or some other command.

- We can select processes owned by user, e.g.: `$ ps -f -u dkuhlman`
  or `$ ps -f -u dkuhlman,root`.  `-U` selects by real user ID and
  `-u` selects by effective user ID.


== Display the real path to an executable

Use:

----------
$ which executable_name
----------

Sometimes the executable is a symbolic link (a symlink).  Then use:

----------
$ readlink -f `which executable_name`
----------

Example:

----------
$ readlink -f `which automake`
----------


== Generating date file names

Consider this:

----------
echo $(date "+%b_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S")
----------

I can use that in a command line or bash script to put a date/time
in a file name.


== Headless

There is some kind of problem with running Ubuntu GNU/Linux
headless, i.e.  without a monitor and without a keyboard.

I followed the instructions here:

- http://www.ghacks.net/2010/11/28/configure-linux-to-boot-without-a-monitor/

- http://hungrypenguin.net/linuxandme/2011/08/ubuntu-without-a-monitor/

I followed the instructions at `hungrypenguin` (above).
I created `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` and edited `/etc/default/grub` and then ran
`sudo grub-update`.  Also,, see my notes at ~/Txt/Notes.txt on quail.
Backup is in {crow}~/Tmp/headless.zip.


== Locale

To set the locale, I changed /etc/default/locale.  I replaced the
"LANG=" line:

----------
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
----------

I did this on +bluejay+.


== Ubuntu releases and upgrading

See:

- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

- https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/installing-upgrading.html


== Vim

String functions:

----------
:echom tolower("Foo")
:echom toupper("Foo")
----------


Fixing comment insert and column 1 problem -- I turned off both
`cindent` and `smartindent` in my `.vimrc`.  And, I'm now using
`filetype plugin indent on`.  For more help with the issue of
forcing "#" to column 1 in Python code, see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/354097/how-to-configure-vim-to-not-put-comments-at-the-beginning-of-lines-while-editing


== ls command and file types

From: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/82357/what-do-the-symbols-displayed-by-ls-f-mean

`ls -F` appends symbols to filenames. These symbols show useful
information about files.

  * @ means symbolic link (or that the file has extended attributes).
  * * means executable.
  * = means socket.
  * | means named pipe.
  * > means door.
  * / means directory.


== File links -- hard and symbolic

=== Finding all files that share a hard link

You can use this:

----------
$ find . -samefile somefile.txt
$ find ~ -samefile anotherfile.txt
$ find / -samefile /home/dkuhlman/a1/Notes/Bzr/Notes/Notes_linux.txt
----------

Do `man find` for more information.

Hard links to the same file have the same `inode` number.  To see
the `inode` numbers, do: `ls -li`.

More information on file links is here:

- https://opensource.com/article/17/6/linking-linux-filesystem

- https://superuser.com/questions/12972/how-can-you-see-the-actual-hard-link-by-ls


== Configuring the network and IP addresses

For information about configuring a machine so that it uses a static
IP address, see:
https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html


== Hard drives etc

Use `lsblk` to discover the UUID of a logical partition.  E.g.:

----------
$ lsblk -f /dev/sda5
----------


== Status line -- `powerline`

For enhanced status line and prompts, see:
https://github.com/powerline/powerline


== byobu and tmux

To kill extra, spurious sessions, do: (1) attach to a different
session, (2) get a tmux command line with `Ctrl-A :`,  (3) use this
tmux command:

----------
kill-session -t <session-name>.
----------

Or, from the command line, use one of:

----------
$ byobu kill-session -t <session-name>
$ tmux kill-session -t <session-name>
----------


== Managing LVM volumes

=== Commands and operations

Create a new logical volume "crow-vg-1" in volume group "crow-vg":

----------
sudo lvcreate -n crow-vg-1 -L 32g crow-vg
----------

Activate the new logical volume:

----------
sudo vgchange -a y
----------

Make a file system on the new logical volume:

----------
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/crow-vg/crow-vg-1
----------

Display logical volumes:

----------
sudo lvdisplay
----------

Display logical group:

----------
sudo vgdisplay
----------

=== Status and information

Now I can use `df -h` and I see:

----------
$ df -h
Filesystem                        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev                              977M     0  977M   0% /dev
tmpfs                             200M  3.4M  197M   2% /run
/dev/mapper/crow--vg-root          26G  2.2G   22G   9% /
tmpfs                            1000M     0 1000M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs                             5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs                            1000M     0 1000M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/mapper/crow--vg-crow--vg--1   32G   49M   30G   1% /home/dkuhlman/a1
tmpfs                             200M     0  200M   0% /run/user/1000
----------

And, I can use the file system under `~/a1`.


== Managing another hard disk

Mount another hard disk manually:

----------
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home/dkuhlman/b1
----------

Add this to `/etc/fstab` to mount it automatically:

----------
----------


// vim:ft=asciidoc:
