== What good it does me and why I need to write

Some reasons:

- Writing makes me more aware.

- I investigate and become more aware of more in the way of details.

- I remember more (I believe) when I write about it.

- It forces, or at least encourages me to think up new ideas, new
  perspectives, new reasons for my believes, etc.

- It encourages me to question my beliefs and the reasons for my
  ideas.

- Writing makes me a bit more hopeful; it helps me feel that I've
  accomplished something; it makes me believe that I understand
  myself and my world a little bit more.  That feeling of hope that
  I will be able soon, tomorrow, next week to understand a bit more
  and to write about it is important to me: I do not want to be
  forlorn and depressed and in despair.  I want some hope and some
  joy.


== Why I write with ink (or pencil) on paper

I do not have a good answer for this question.  There are benefits
to each.

. I enjoy the feel of writing on paper with a ballpoint
  pen.

. I appreciate being able to "pile up" the papers I write
  on: it makes me feel that I'm accomplishing something.
  
. On the other hand, text files (like this Asciidoc file):

  [loweralpha]
  .. are searchable,
  .. more editable
  .. can be formatted in various ways (e.g. to HTML, PDF, etc)
  .. can be kept in a repository and a Wiki (like this one).

. And, light weight markup languages like Asciidoc and
  reStructuredText, are usable with some Wiki engines.
