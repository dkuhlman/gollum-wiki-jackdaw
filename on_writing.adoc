== Why I need to write

== What good it does me

== Why I write with ink (or pencil) on paper

I do not have a good answer for this question.  There are benefits
to each.  (1) I enjoy the feel of writing on paper with a ballpoint
pen.  (2) I appreciate being able to "pile up" the papers I write
on: it makes me feel that I'm accomplishing something.  (3) On the
other hand, text files (like this Asciidoc file) are searchable,
more editable, can be formatted in various ways (e.g. to HTML, PDF,
etc), and can be kept in a repository and a Wiki (like this one).
