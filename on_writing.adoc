== What good it does me and why I need to write

Some reasons:

- Writing makes me more aware.

- I investigate and become more aware of more in the way of details.

- I remember more (I believe) when I write about it.

- It forces, or at least encourages me to think up new ideas, new
  perspectives, new reasons for my believes, etc.

- It encourages me to question my beliefs and the reasons for my
  ideas.


== Why I write with ink (or pencil) on paper

I do not have a good answer for this question.  There are benefits
to each.  (1) I enjoy the feel of writing on paper with a ballpoint
pen.  (2) I appreciate being able to "pile up" the papers I write
on: it makes me feel that I'm accomplishing something.  (3) On the
other hand, text files (like this Asciidoc file) are searchable,
more editable, can be formatted in various ways (e.g. to HTML, PDF,
etc), and can be kept in a repository and a Wiki (like this one).
